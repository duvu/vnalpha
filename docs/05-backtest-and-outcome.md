# 05. Backtest and outcome tracking

## Purpose

Backtesting and outcome tracking are the validation layer of `vnalpha`.

The question is not only:

```text
Did the system detect a pattern?
```

The real question is:

```text
Did detected patterns produce a repeatable statistical edge after realistic constraints?
```

## Two validation modes

`vnalpha` should support two complementary validation modes.

### 1. Pattern outcome tracking

Every detected pattern is stored and later evaluated after fixed horizons.

Horizons:

```text
5 sessions
10 sessions
20 sessions
60 sessions
```

This is the most important validation mechanism for the MVP.

### 2. Strategy backtesting

A full backtest simulates entry/exit rules, stop losses, position sizing, fees, and market regime filters.

This should come after pattern detection and outcome tracking are stable.

## Pattern outcome schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE pattern_outcome (
    pattern_id BIGINT,
    horizon_days INT,
    forward_return DOUBLE,
    index_return DOUBLE,
    sector_return DOUBLE,
    excess_return DOUBLE,
    max_gain DOUBLE,
    max_drawdown DOUBLE,
    hit_invalidation BOOLEAN,
    hit_take_profit BOOLEAN,
    outcome_label TEXT,
    evaluated_at TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (pattern_id, horizon_days)
);
```

## Outcome metrics

For each pattern, calculate:

```text
forward_return_Nd
index_return_Nd
sector_return_Nd
excess_return_Nd
max_gain_Nd
max_drawdown_Nd
max_adverse_excursion
max_favorable_excursion
hit_invalidation
hit_take_profit
```

Where:

```text
excess_return = stock_forward_return - benchmark_forward_return
```

Benchmarks:

```text
VN-Index
sector index, if available
VN30, if applicable
```

## Outcome labels

Initial label rules:

### SUCCESS

```text
forward_return_20d > 8%
AND excess_return_20d > 3%
AND max_drawdown_20d > -7%
```

### FAIL

```text
hit_invalidation = true
OR max_drawdown_20d <= -7%
OR excess_return_20d < -3%
```

### NEUTRAL

```text
neither SUCCESS nor FAIL
```

These thresholds should be configurable.

## Backtest scenarios

MVP should test at least these entry assumptions:

### Scenario A: close-entry reference only

```text
Entry: close price on signal date
Purpose: analytical reference only
```

This is not realistic if the signal is generated after market close.

### Scenario B: next-open entry

```text
Entry: next session open
Purpose: realistic end-of-day workflow
```

### Scenario C: pullback entry

```text
Entry: first pullback near breakout level or MA20
Purpose: reduce chase risk
```

## Exit rules

Initial exit rules:

```text
Exit after 5/10/20 sessions
Stop loss at invalidation level
Stop loss below MA20
Take profit at +10% or +15%
Trailing stop after profit threshold
```

Each rule should be tested separately.

## Required backtest metrics

```text
number_of_trades
win_rate
average_return
median_return
profit_factor
expectancy
max_drawdown
average_holding_days
false_breakout_rate
return_by_year
return_by_market_regime
return_by_sector
```

## Avoiding common backtest errors

### Look-ahead bias

A signal generated after close cannot assume entry at that same close in a realistic strategy.

Bad:

```text
Signal uses close of day T.
Backtest buys at close of day T.
```

Better:

```text
Signal uses close of day T.
Backtest buys at open of T+1 or later.
```

### Survivorship bias

The universe should not include only stocks that still exist today if the backtest period includes delisted or inactive stocks.

MVP may accept this limitation temporarily, but it should be documented.

### Liquidity bias

Backtests must exclude or penalize low-liquidity stocks.

Minimum filters:

```text
average traded value threshold
minimum volume threshold
maximum position size as percentage of average daily value
```

### Fees and taxes

Backtest should include:

```text
brokerage fee
transaction tax
slippage
spread assumption
```

### Corporate actions

If prices are not adjusted for splits/dividends, pattern detection and returns can be wrong.

Data quality checks should flag potential corporate-action anomalies.

## Market regime validation

Backtest results should be split by regime:

```text
UPTREND
SIDEWAY
DISTRIBUTION
DOWNTREND
RECOVERY
```

A pattern that works only in strong uptrends should not be treated as universally valid.

## Parameter testing

Example parameters:

```text
base_range_pct: 10%, 12%, 15%, 20%
base_window: 20, 30, 40, 60 sessions
volume_ratio: 1.3x, 1.5x, 2.0x
rs_window: 20, 30, 60 sessions
max_distance_to_ma20: 6%, 8%, 10%
```

The goal is not to find the best-looking historical parameter. The goal is to find stable parameter zones.

## Output reports

The backtest module should produce:

```text
pattern summary
false breakout report
return distribution
regime breakdown
sector breakdown
parameter sensitivity report
```

## MVP implementation recommendation

Use:

```text
VectorBT for vectorized backtests
Pandas for outcome tracking
DuckDB for storing outcome tables
```

MVP commands:

```bash
python -m vnalpha.outcome.evaluate_forward_returns --as-of today
python -m vnalpha.backtest.run_pattern_backtest --pattern ACCUMULATION_BREAKOUT
```

## Decision rule

No new AI/ML ranking layer should be added until the system can answer:

```text
What is the historical success rate of each pattern type?
What is the false breakout rate?
Which market regime makes the pattern fail?
Which features separate successful from failed patterns?
```
