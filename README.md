# vnalpha

`vnalpha` is an OpenBB-inspired, AI-assisted research workspace service for Vietnamese equities.

It is designed to run as an independent workspace service that consumes market data from `vnstock-service` instead of embedding provider-specific data access logic.

vnstock-service  = data platform service
vnalpha-service  = research workspace service

## Product direction

`vnalpha` should behave like a Vietnam-focused investment research workspace:

- connect to `vnstock-service` for validated market/reference/fundamental data;
- build and own research datasets such as canonical OHLCV, features, patterns, outcomes, watchlists, reports, and journals;
- provide interactive workspace screens for analysts and AI agents;
- expose a workspace API for dashboards, notebooks, CLI/TUI, and future agent tools;
- keep data lineage, scoring evidence, assumptions, and forward outcomes auditable.

## Core workflows

The project focuses on end-of-day research workflows:

- ingest validated market data from `vnstock-service`;
- build a canonical OHLCV research dataset;
- compute technical, liquidity, relative-strength, and market-regime features;
- detect structured price/volume patterns such as accumulation bases, breakouts, failed breakouts, VCP, and healthy pullbacks;
- track forward outcomes for every detected pattern;
- run backtests and parameter studies;
- generate AI-assisted explanations, risk critiques, daily reports, and trading journal notes.

## Core principle

`vnalpha` is a research and watchlist workspace, not an auto-trading bot.

The system should not place orders, connect to broker execution APIs, or let an LLM override deterministic risk rules. AI is used for explanation, critique, summarization, and research assistance. Signal generation must remain rule-based, testable, auditable, and validated by backtests/outcome tracking.

## Suggested MVP stack

- Python
- FastAPI for `vnalpha-service`
- Streamlit for first workspace UI
- `vnstock-service` as the data foundation
- DuckDB + Parquet for local research storage
- Pandas / NumPy for feature engineering
- VectorBT for backtesting
- LiteLLM or a compatible LLM gateway for AI explanations
